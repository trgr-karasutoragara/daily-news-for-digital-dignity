## Why use it?

You—and only you—can manage your RSS subscription list on your PC or smartphone.
It's lightweight and runs fast because it's so simple.

<br>

## What are the drawbacks?

It **does not support sync**.
As a workaround, you can export your data and import it on another device.
However, there's no automatic synchronization like a login-based service would offer.

<br>

## Is it extendable?

Yes. It’s under the **MIT License**, so you're free to modify and use it as you like.

<br>

## Philosophy Behind It

With the rise of AI, the amount of information we encounter will likely continue to grow.
That also means more effort will be needed to verify whether something is real or fake.
By using RSS to whitelist trustworthy sources, you can protect yourself from unnecessary effort and misinformation.

This is a rational and resilient choice—built on old, stable, and well-tested technology, free to use, and light on storage.
The tool starts at just **25.8KB (English version)** or **26.8KB (Japanese version)**, and even as your data grows, it stays **well below 1MB**.

**Perhaps we, as information consumers, can choose to engage with the world in a much simpler way.**
