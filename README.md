# prototype-rss-news.py / trgr_post.py / trgr_post_with_ai.py
A prototype for news acquisition methods combining RSS and LLM

## What is this
Redesigned a personal RSS news link collection distribution program as an international version.
- [trgr_post.py](https://github.com/trgr-karasutoragara/daily-news-for-digital-dignity/blob/main/trgr_post.py): Symbolic translation system (basic version)
- [trgr_post_with_ai.py](https://github.com/trgr-karasutoragara/daily-news-for-digital-dignity/blob/main/trgr_post_with_ai.py): Gemini 2.0 Flash batch translation (API efficiency version)
- [prototype-rss-news.py](https://github.com/trgr-karasutoragara/daily-news-for-digital-dignity/blob/main/g/prototype-rss-news.py): **RSS + Gemma 3 1B** international version proof of concept. [Sample is available here](https://github.com/trgr-karasutoragara/daily-news-for-digital-dignity/tree/main/g).

There are three types as above.

## How to use
I think it would be comfortable to have Gmail app passwords and Gemini API keys.

From the perspective of democratizing technology, prototype-rss-news.py actually runs the program on a 2018 PC as a home server in a CUI/CLI environment. 4GB memory is tough for running open-source AI.

However,
```
8th Gen Intel Core i3-8100 (Coffee Lake)
4 cores
16GB memory
500GB HDD storage
```
With the above environment, there are open-source options. Even with old computers, there are things that can be done.

## **Project Philosophy**
Technology should serve human dignity, not replace it.

If you are in a developing country, you can utilize this for improving education and social structural issues. If you are in a developed country, in addition to that, I expect you can deal with information flooding and information overload. Wherever in the world you are, information is important for holding hope and drawing dreams.
