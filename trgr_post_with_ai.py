## Background

This script is an AI-enhanced version of the personalized news generator,
originally created to support the digital dignity of an elderly woman born in 1947.

Using Gemini 2.0 Flash (via the API), this version adds:
– Automatic selection and sorting of top international news articles
– Optional translation using a large language model (currently limited by quota)

This script is part of the same project as:
**[AI and Elderly Dignity: A Speech Draft for Researchers](https://www.academia.edu/129405187/AI_and_Elderly_Dignity)**
